 Requirements:
   The requirements for the Amazon Locker service are defined below:

   R1: Customers can select a preferred locker location for order pickup during checkout.

   R2: An order may contain one or more items. Based on locker size availability, items are packaged together if possible.

   R3: Locker locations contain multiple lockers of various sizes (extra small, small, medium, large, extra large, double extra large).

   R4: Only packages that fit fully within the locker’s interior dimensions are eligible for delivery.

   R5: When a package is delivered to the selected locker, the customer receives a unique code (e.g., a 6-digit PIN) to open the locker.

   R6: Packages are held in the locker for three days.

   R7: Each locker location has defined opening and closing hours; customers must pick up packages within the 3-day window and the location’s operating hours.

   R8: If a package is not picked up within three days, it is removed from the locker, the locker is released, and the customer is refunded.

   R9: Multiple lockers are available at every locker location; each can only be assigned to one customer/package at a time.

   R10: Once a package is collected, the locker is closed and locked; the provided access code is invalidated and cannot be reused.

   R11: Customers may return eligible items by selecting a nearby locker location. Based on package size and location, an available locker is assigned. A new, unique code is sent to the user to open the locker and place the return package.

   R12: The logistics team stores returned items in lockers for pickup; the logistics team uses a unique code to collect the returned package. The customer is notified once the return is processed, and the refund policy is applied per product eligibility.

   Out of scope:
   - How the package gets to the locker (delivery logistics)
   - UI/rendering layer
